            The Gold Coast is a coastal resort town. Then one of the most exciting activities is surfing! 
            The Gold Coast really is a surfer's paradise with many beaches for surfing, 
            such as at Burleigh, Currumbin, Kirra, and Snapper Rocks, a National Surfing Reserve.</br>
            If you are a beginner, don't worry about it! Please follow the suggestions:</br>
            No matter how easy you think surfing looks, never surf alone. Either find an experienced friend 
            to teach you, or attend a beginner surf camp, or find a good teacher who eare xperienced and have good reviews. 
            That way, you won't get hurt or even risk your life.

            If you love the lovely creatures - seagulls - then the Gold Coast is the ideal destination for you. 
            They are found all over the Gold Coast, but most of the time you can see flocks of seagulls 
            circling on the beach. If you are holding a delicious meal, please be careful to protect your food, 
            they are very dominant!

            The beautiful reverie of people's seaside holiday is always inseparable from the blue sky, 
            cotton-candy white clouds, boundless sea and golden sandy beaches...... 
            The Gold Coast, with more than 70 kilometers of long coastline, is not short of straight golden sandy beaches.</br>
            The beach in the picture is called Surfers Paradise, the shining "star" of the Gold Coast's many beaches 
            and a popular destination for surfers from all over the world, with many international surfing events taking place here.</br>
            Surfers Paradise is a golden match between the skyscrapers behind it and the blue sea in front of it.
